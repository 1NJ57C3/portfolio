      <p>
        I&lsquo;m a front-end-leaning full-stack developer with a solid
        foundation in React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and semantic HTML. I enjoy
        crafting intuitive user interfaces and have experience with backend
        technologies like Ruby on Rails. My approach focuses on writing
        flexible, scalable code that can adapt as projects grow, making me
        versatile across the stack.
      </p>

        Recently, I&lsquo;ve been switching from JavaScript to TypeScript and
        exploring backend development with Django. My current priority is
        refining my portfolio, which includes projects like a React Native
        weather app. I&lsquo;m also working to deepen my backend skills and
        strengthen my understanding of databases like PostgreSQL and SQLite.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the core of my development process is a passion for problem-solving.
        I enjoy tackling complex challenges, constantly learning, and building
        maintainable solutions.
      </p>

        When I&lsquo;m not coding, you&lsquo;ll probably find me gaming,
        listening to music on Spotify (mostly EDM like melodic bass/dubstep and
        vocal trance, if you&lsquo;re savvy), or playing guitar (rather poorly).
        You might also find me at the archery range or in a swimming pool to
        clear my mind, although there&lsquo;s nothing better than driving...
        probably a little too fast.
