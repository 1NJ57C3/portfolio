# Portfolio  

This repo contains yet another attempt at building out my portfolio; hopefully, the last one. Writing about yourself is super hard, I don't care what anyone says!  

This project was built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [PnPM](https://pnpm.io/).

## Installation and Operation  

Open your Command Line, navigate to this project's root folder, and run the following commands:

`PnPM`:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

`npm`:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once Vite is running, you can either press `o + enter` to open this application in your browser, or navigate to [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) manually.
